### GoBarter

This is a barter trade web page, where users can exchange items online.

The page works like this:
1. Sing in
2. Upload an item with a description and what you would like to exchange it for
3. Go find cool stuff (use our search engine and filters)
4. Mark the item you like
5. If the owner of that item likes yours, you matched! Go exchange your items.

### Documentation

The web is programmed in Node.js, it has two main directories: api and web.
It has a client-server structure, api being the server and web being the client.
